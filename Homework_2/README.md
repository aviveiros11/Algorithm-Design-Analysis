# Homework 2 Programming <br />
(Maximum 25 points; extra credit after the first two programming exercises) <br />
Due 11:59 pm Wednesday February 6, 2019 <br />

Implement a graph traversal algorithm using the breadth-first search and run the program against
the graph shown in the written Exercise 1 of Homework 2. An adjacency list -- not an adjacency
matrix or an edge list -- structured as shown in the written Exercise 1 of Homework 2 must be
used as the data structure of the graph. Use exactly the same order of nodes in each linked list
connected to the array of vertices, or your program output may be different. In each run, the
program should prompt a screen input of the vertex number (1 to 8) and, once the number is
entered, output the vertex number each time a new vertex is visited during the graph traversal.
Your program code will be tested for multiple alternative start vertices. Submit the source codes
via Blackboard. Program codes should be working and neatly organized and well commented.
